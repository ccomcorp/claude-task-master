Implementing the Task Master state management refactoring as outlined in the PRD.

Progress so far:
1. Analyzed the current codebase to identify all places with direct file operations
2. Created state-store.js module with a centralized state store using EventEmitter
3. Implemented action creators in actions.js that replace direct file operations
4. Created state change observers in observers.js for persistence and logging

Next steps:
1. Update the task-manager.js module to use the new state store
2. Refactor commands.js to use action creators instead of direct file access
3. Update ui.js to get task data from the state store
4. Refactor dependency-manager.js to use the centralized state
5. Create tests for the new architecture
